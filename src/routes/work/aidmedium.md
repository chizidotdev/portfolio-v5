During my time at Aidmedium, I played a crucial role in client-facing projects and full-stack development. My achievements include:
<br/>

- Interfacing with clients regularly to gather requirements, understand their unique needs, and deliver tailored software solutions.
- Integrating various third-party CMS platforms such as Sanity.io and WordPress to provide flexible content management options for clients.
- Developing an in-house Content Management System (CMS) to streamline e-commerce template management.
- Cross-functional collaboration with designers, backend developers, and project managers to deliver cohesive and high-quality products on time.
