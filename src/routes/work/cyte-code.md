As a Frontend Developer at Cyte-Code, I was responsible for translating designs into functional and aesthetically pleasing web interfaces. My primary responsibilities included:
<br/>

- Converting design mockups into responsive, high-performance web pages.
- Integrating APIs to enhance frontend functionality and ensure seamless data flow between the frontend and backend systems.
- Worked closely with designers to ensure the visual fidelity of implementations and alignment with user experience goals.
